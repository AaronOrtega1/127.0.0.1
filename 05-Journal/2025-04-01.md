<< [[2025-03-31]] - [[2025-04-02]] >>
## **On this day:** [[2024-04-01]]
## **Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I have to review 3 of my past leet code problems and do 2 more, study the algorithms used in this problems, like two pointers, slicing window, and all those.
## 📝 **To-Dos**
- [x] **At least 6 hours of programming** 💻 (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
- [x] **Read 30 min** 📖 (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
- [x] **Practice Japanese** 🈵 (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
- [x] **Drink 2 liters of water** 💧 (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
- [x] **Wake up on time** ⏰ (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
- [x] **Write on my journal** 📝 (+10 EXP / -5 HP)
## **Morning Brain Dump:**
Ishiro is my new roomie, he started crying because it was to early for him to be up and stopped once I turned off the lights. Not going to the gym today because I don't feel so good today, I prefer to rest and return with full strength later.
## **Reflection:**
Today was a productive day, I learned and reviewed a lot of stuff, tomorrow while be the same, each day I become a better programmer. I also want to gamify my task so I feel more motivated each day to continue doing them. Obsidian is not built for this, I will try notion to gamify my life for a little bit.
