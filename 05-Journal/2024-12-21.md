**On this day:** [[2023-12-21]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I’m going to donate blood for my aunt’s operation, then in the afternoon I will go to see my girlfriend and give her the present I brought her for christmas, I really hope she likes it, it wasn’t my original plan to gift her those earrings but the machine to engrave the charms in the pandoras that I went didn’t work.

**To-Dos:**
- [ ] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [ ] Read 30 min
- [x] Practice Japanese
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I changed my mind in the book that I will gift my brother, I think that he will like more meditation by Marco Aurelio, I hope it arrives in time.

**Reflection:**
