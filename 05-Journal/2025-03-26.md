**Morning Brain Dump:**
Today I woke up in time but I went back to sleeping, I have to as soon as my alarm goes off I get up from my bed.

**Reflection:**
Another day doing leet code problems, I'm starting to see a little bit of improvement in my problem solving skills for array problems. I don't know why my obsidian in my phone doesn't recognize that this daily note already exist and creates a new one.
