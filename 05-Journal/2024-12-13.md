**On this day:** [[2023-12-13]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
I went to train in the morning muay thai, and for a quesadilla to the tianguis, it was delicious, now I have to work and in the night I have my first posada from work, I'm going with my girlfriend and some members of my team.

**To-Dos:**
- [ ] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [x] Read 30 min
- [x] Work
- [ ] Practice Japanese
- [x] Go train muay thai
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I'm still not used to waking up early workout and then work, maybe it's because its vacations and that makes it feel heavier, but I'm going to keep doing it.

**Reflection:**
Been feeling great, more productive, like putting my life together.
