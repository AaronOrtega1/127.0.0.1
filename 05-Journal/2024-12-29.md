**On this day:** [[2023-12-29]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I will finish my arch setup finally and will try to make a guide for my future self, divide packages for the official arch repo and the aur repo.

**To-Dos:**
- [x] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [x] Read 30 min
- [ ] Practice Japanese
- [x] Finish arch setup.

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I slept like a baby last night.

**Reflection:**
Having everything al ready configured made reinstalling and configuring arch a thousand times easier, what the first time took me days, without even knowing what I was doing taking someone elses config and installing a bunch of things that I didn't even know was dumb making a dirty install and a mess of files and folders I didn't even know where they came from. Now I have a clean install with only the things I need and configured the way I want it to be.
