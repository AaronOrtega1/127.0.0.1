**On this day:** [[2023-12-15]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I did a carne asada with my family, I tried doing ribs in the grill, but I overcooked them and they didn't taste good, I have to learn how to cook them properly.

**To-Dos:**
- [x] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [x] Read 30 min
- [x] Practice Japanese
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I had a little headache in the morning, but it went away in a little time, today since is Sunday its my rest day so I'm not very active with many things, but i'm still going to continue with my udemy course and reading as well.

**Reflection:**
Having days like this are also important, being able to relax, doing this that I enjoy, having some quality time with my family, I really like this.
