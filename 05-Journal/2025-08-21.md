<< [[2025-08-20]] - [[2025-08-22]] >>

**On this day:** [[2024-08-21]]
## Planned Highlights of the Day:
Today I'm going to do my first practice exam for my AWS SAA certificate, and see which parts I need to study more

## To-Dos
- [x] First [[1747853373-aws-certified-solution-architect-associate-2025|AWS SAA 2025]] practice exam.
- [x] Do the README for [[1755567229-power-bi-and-sql-project|Power BI and SQL Project]].
- [x] Update CV with new project and udemy certificate.
- [x] Go train MMA.

## Morning Brain Dump:
Today is going to be another productive day in which I will finish a lot of things for my professional development.

## Reflection:
Today I finished my Power BI and SQL Project and uploaded it to my CV so It looks more like a data analyst, I also got my udemy certificate that i finished the AWS SAA course, I'm grateful with myself for doing all of this things to increase my knowledge.
I also did my first AWS SAA practice exam, got a **58%** it's not a good note but it's a start, with this I have a true sense of what I'm lacking on, I will focus on reviewing my AWS material with the new studying technique that I just started applying with notebook ml and space repetition cards for active recall.
