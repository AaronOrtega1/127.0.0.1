**Morning Brain Dump:**
I woke up with more energy than yesterday, I only have to make my body used to waking up early again, it will help me keeping a productive routine.

**Reflection:**
I been enjoying my new note taking-flow with obsidian I think it's great It cover almost everything I need, also connecting it to my phone was one of the greatest things I could do. Right now the only thing that I'm missing is a way to control my finances, I thing that notion will be the best option since I can use my phone to record all that, but I will see.
