**Morning Brain Dump:**
I slept like a baby, I don’t even remember at what time I felt sleep, but now I’m well rested and ready for another day.

**Reflection:**
I felt more dispersed today, like I could focus in anything, and i’m starting to feel like i’m spending a lot of time in making my note taking system more adapted to my style and don’t know if it’s worth.
