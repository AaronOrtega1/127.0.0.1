## Planned Highlights of the Day
Today I'm going to two halloween parties with my GF in the night, and I'm going to continue with my fullstack course.

## Daily Quests
- [x] Unlock new secrets of [[1761749354-fullstack-development-bootcamp-udemy|Quest: Fullstack Development Bootcamp Udemy]]
- [x] Unlock new secrets of [[1759955068-master-the-java-blades-data-structures-&-algorithms|Quest: Master the Java Blades: Data Structures & Algorithms]]
- [ ] Forge one new component of my portfolio project that I'm proud to showcase.

## Council of Thoughts
Tried yesterday in the night to configure my own neovim config, it's too much trouble configuring the LSP and then the CMP to integrate everything, I opted with staying with my current config using LazyVim by the great folke.
