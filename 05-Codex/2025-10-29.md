## Planned Highlights of the Day
Today I hope Ana Karen that is a girl that helps people with their CVs and on how to prepare for interviews contacts me so we can schedule a call, and since I'm not getting any luck in my Data Analysis search for a job I'm going to switch it and go back to web development and hopefully get something fast just in the mean time.

## Daily Quests
- [ ] Architect the solution to one critical [[1743802715-school|school]] assignment.
- [ ] Conduct the daily ritual (review flashcards) to bind AWS incantations to my neural pathways.
- [ ] Unlock new secrets of [[1756144012-business-intelligence-analyst-udemy-course-2025|Business Intelligence in the Udemy scrolls]].
- [ ] [[1759955068-master-the-java-blades-data-structures-&-algorithms|Master the Java Blades: Data Structures & Algorithms]]

## Council of Thoughts
I slept like a baby and I feel ready to get started for a fullstack role.
