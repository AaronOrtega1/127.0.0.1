## Planned Highlights of the Day
Today I hope Ana Karen that is a girl that helps people with their CVs and on how to prepare for interviews contacts me so we can schedule a call, and since I'm not getting any luck in my Data Analysis search for a job I'm going to switch it and go back to web development and hopefully get something fast just in the mean time.

## Daily Quests
- [x] Architect the solution to one critical [[1743802715-school|school]] assignment.
- [x] Unlock new secrets of [[1761749354-fullstack-development-bootcamp-udemy|Quest: Fullstack Development Bootcamp Udemy]]
- [x] [[1759955068-master-the-java-blades-data-structures-&-algorithms|Master the Java Blades: Data Structures & Algorithms]]
- [x] Comment my code in the [[1759955068-master-the-java-blades-data-structures-&-algorithms|Quest: Master the Java Blades: Data Structures & Algorithms]].

## Council of Thoughts
I slept like a baby and I feel ready to get started for a fullstack role.

## Chronicle of the Day
I believe that today was a productive day, maybe I didn't do as much as other days but I still did something, that is a great step.
