<< [[2025-01-27]] - [[2025-01-29]] >>

**On this day:** [[2024-01-28]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I will ask my father to go buy flowers for Esme, since tomorrow it's her birthday and I want to gift them some, I will be broke after her birthday but there isn't much time left for payday so its fine.

**To-Dos:**
- [x] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [x] Read 30 min
- [x] Work
- [x] Practice Japanese
- [ ] Exercise at least 1 hour
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I have a duty to fulfill, I'm tired but that is nothing, I will keep going forward for my future.

**Reflection:**
This weeks first two days where pretty exhausting because I had to work 10 hours a day, but it's all worth it because tomorrow I will go to my girlfriends birthday without the preoccupation of having to work when I get back.
