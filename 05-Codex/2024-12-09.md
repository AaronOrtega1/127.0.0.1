**On this day:** [[2023-12-09]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Woke up early to go to muay thai and I have to work, there isn't much else planned.

**To-Dos:**
- [x] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [ ] Read 30 min
- [x] Work
- [x] Practice Japanese
- [x] Train muay thai
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
I have less energy because I woke up early, but I'm going to work and then after that I can rest, I have responsibilities. 

**Reflection:**
Muay thai is going to be great in many ways, it will show me how to defend myself and is a good change of air from the gym that was the only exercise I was doing, I can't wait for my venum shin guards.
