<< [[2025-08-17]] - [[2025-08-19]] >>

**On this day:** [[2024-08-18]]
## Planned Highlights of the Day:
Today I'm going to finish my laptop setup and continue my AWS study for my certification.

## To-Dos
- [x] Finish laptop setup
- [x] AWS course
- [x] Review AWS Flashcards
- [x] Go train MMA

## Morning Brain Dump:
I woke up early to go to the gym and it was close, but I had to go anyway to my uni so I could give my GF a test to ease her stress, it's impossible that it's going to come out as positive.

## Reflection:
I think that my laptop setup is complete, I only need some little tweaks that I will be doing through the week, but nothing big.
I'm excited and nervous at the same time that this will be my last semester of uni, excited because I do want to graduate but nervous because I'm still unemployed, I will not graduate unemployed, I'm going to do everything that I have to get a good job in something that I enjoy.
