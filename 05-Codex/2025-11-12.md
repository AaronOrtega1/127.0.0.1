## Chronicle of the Day
Today I didn't have much chance to practice programming to prepare myself for coding interviews since I was out almost all day trying to get my car out of the corralon, I went with my that to transito to make the change of ownership procedure to get it out of the corralon without much sucess, we don't have the original invoice and we need it.
