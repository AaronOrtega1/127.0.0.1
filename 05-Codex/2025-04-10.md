<< [[2025-04-09]] - [[2025-04-11]] >>

**On this day:** [[2024-04-10]]
## Planned Highlights of the Day:
Today I'm going to do some review from thinks that I've learned in the past, so I have them fresh in memory and ready to use whenever.
## To-Dos
- [x] Finish passing my SQL notes to this new obsidian.
- [x] Practice 4 of the past neet problems that I solved.
- [>] Review how to clean data with SQL.
## Morning Brain Dump:
I slept like a baby, I was really tired and from all the activity from yesterday, so I needed to sleep more, I will go to the gym later in the day.
## Reflection:
Day full of good things, FICO answered me real fast for the next step of the process, I'm not going to have my PAP on saturday and I will go tomorrow to eat with my GF. I'm also enjoying more and more my new note taking system, I think that it's cleaner than the previous one.
