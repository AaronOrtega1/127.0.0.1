## Council of Thoughts
I slept like a baby, and I'm almost finished with my neovim config, I'm only missing fine tunning some keybind but I have everything that I need.

## Chronicle of the Day
Ready to get my photo taken for my degree, I'm finally going to graduate after half a career in accounting and a full engineering degree. I'm excited also for the message about the job opportunity, maybe it's not what I'm hoping for but it's better than being unemployed.
