## Morning Brain Dump:
I overslept a little but it's not a problem since I have my class online and I can wake up 5 minutes earlier and be okay.

## Reflection:
I did the English test of the IBM internship, I hope that they send me a message quickly that they have an offer for me, I'm sick and tired of not having work.
