## Council of Thoughts
I'm grateful that my GF niece is finally going to be allowed to exit the hospital to go to her house, poor baby had to endure 3 days in intensive therapy.
## Chronicle of the Day
I'm excited for tomorrows interview, it has to go well, it sounds like a good opportunity in a start up that is already in the growing stage, the responsibilities sound great and that I would enjoy working for them. Even If they offer me only like > 16k per month I would definitely accept.
