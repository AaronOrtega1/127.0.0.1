Today I'm going to work with my dad, I have to be useful in other ways since I don't have a job and he has been spending a lot of money in my graduation and in my last college semester.

## Daily Quests
- [x] Architect the solution to one critical [[1743802715-school|school]] assignment.

- [x] Train my hand-to-hand combat skills.
- [x] Make a note about what I learned in my hand-to-hand combat class.

## Council of Thoughts
Yesterday I think that I finished my neovim config, of my own, with only the things that I need, maybe I will add the Snacks dashboard just for the aesthetics of it.

## Chronicle of the Day
Today I helped my father, finished my nvim config, my HM #19 of my class [[1755608534-integracion-de-servicios-de-aprendizaje-automatico|Integración de Servicios de Aprendizaje Automático]] and went to train.
