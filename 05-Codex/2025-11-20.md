## Council of Thoughts
Yesterday was a good experience going to the event for future graduates at my university, I had fun and got to take pictures with my GF and my friends.

## Chronicle of the Day
Today I decided to shift my study progress into a more realistic one with sessions of 4.5 hours, focused in fullstack web development and DSA learning, this will help me not feel burnout and to better manage my time and energy.
