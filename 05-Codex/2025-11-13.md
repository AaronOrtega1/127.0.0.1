## Planned Highlights of the Day
Today I'm going to finish studying bit manipulation operations with python and do the IBM code assessment for the data analysis role.

## Daily Quests
- [x] Train strength at the iron temple.
- [x] Clean my bed sheets.
- [-] Unlock new secrets of [[1759955068-master-the-java-blades-data-structures-&-algorithms|Quest: Master the Java Blades: Data Structures & Algorithms]]
- [-] Do IBM code assessment.
- [x] Train my hand-to-hand combat skills.
- [-] Make a note about what I learned in my hand-to-hand combat class.

## Council of Thoughts
Today it's going to be a productive day, I will do everything that I had planned and rest well, maybe I postpone the code assessment for tomorrow, I don't feel confident to solve a bit manipulation problem.
