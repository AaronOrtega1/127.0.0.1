<< [[2025-01-14]] - [[2025-01-16]] >>

**On this day:** [[2024-01-15]]

**Planned Highlights of the Day:**
Today I'm going to cut my hair in the afternoon and continue studying the basics of the [[Tutorial Next.js Basics]] to be ready for the pair programming I'm going to have with Jose of Beserva tomorrow. Didn't go to train today because I'm feeling a little bit sick and want to rest to be ready to go to Tapalpa with my girlfriend and her family and friends.

**To-Dos:**
- [x] Practice at least 1 hour programming
- [x] Read 30 min
- [x] Work
- [x] Practice Japanese
- [x] Exercise at least 1 hour
- [ ] 

**Morning Brain Dump:**
Kinda nervous for tomorrow, don't want to look like an idiot that doesn't know anything, but if I think that if I arrive with the basics I'm going to be alright.

**Reflection:**
Excited to start my new journey developing with next.js, hopefully everything goes well tomorrow.
