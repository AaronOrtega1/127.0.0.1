# Quest: Uroboros Tournament 2k25
## Objective
Compete in the Uroboros tournament to test my skills against opponents with my same level of experience and in the range of my weight and to enjoy the experience of participating in a tournament.

## Tasks
- [x] Assist to the tournament and compete. (XP +20)
- [ ] Pass the first round. (XP +20)
- [ ] Enter the podium. (XP +50)

## Conclusions
- I have a long way to go, I lost in my first match but I defended well, this helped me to see that I have to train harder, and to focus on my defense first, I had some opportunities to escape and I wasted them.
