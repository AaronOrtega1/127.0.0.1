# Final version
Hi, my name is Aarón Ortega, and I’m from Guadalajara, Jalisco, México. I’m currently in my 8th semester studying Computer Systems Engineering at ITESO, and I’ll be graduating this December.

Throughout my degree, I've developed a strong passion for data analysis, which has fueled my curiosity and motivated me to learn more of this field. That is why I'd love to contribute and learn from the professional in FICO, being a leader company in analytics software and services, this internship would be the perfect opportunity for me to grow, collaborating with and absorbing knowledge from industry experts.

I firmly believe that client trust is a pillar of any successful business. That’s why I’ve chosen to talk about **FICO’s AI and machine learning-powered scam protection solution** in this video.

According to a FICO study on financial fraud in México, **75% of consumers rank strong fraud protection among their top 3 priorities when choosing a new bank.** This indicates just how crucial trust is for people in our country. However, there’s another side to the story: **41% of Mexicans believe it’s normal to exaggerate their income when applying for financial products.**

This is where **FICO’s scam protection comes in**. By using AI and machine learning models, FICO not only would help banks make their clients feel safer but also enables them to detect various types of fraud.

First, we could collect the transactions and send them to an **API gateway**. Then, a message queue like **Apache Kafka** would forward these transactions to **FICO’s scam protection models**, which uses data from thousands of institutions worldwide. The models analyze the transactions and return a risk score, which determines whether a transaction is fraudulent. If false positives occur, they can be reviewed and used to **retrain the model**, improving its accuracy over time.
