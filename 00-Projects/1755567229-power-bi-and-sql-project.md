# Power BI and SQL Project
## Objective
Develop a project for my portfolio in which I use SQL and Power BI, to get important insights in the sales of a pizzeria and create a dashboard to present all the requirements that the client whats to know.

## Problem Statement
### KPI's REQUIREMENT
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specially we want to calculate the following metrics:
1. **Total Revenue:** the sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** the average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

### Charts Requirement
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. we have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:** Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:** Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders.
7. **Top 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:** Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders.
