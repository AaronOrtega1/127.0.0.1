# Inferential Statistics & Estimators
### 1.1 Inferential Statistics
- **Definition**: Methods that use probability theory and distributions to **predict population values based on sample data** [1]
- **Goal**: To develop a deep understanding of statistical processes, which is crucial for data science and quantitative research [2]

### 1.2 Estimators & Estimates
- **Estimator**: An approximation of a population parameter that depends solely on sample information [3]
- **Estimate**: A specific value derived from an estimator [3]
- **Types of Estimates**:
  - **Point Estimate**: A single number (e.g., sample mean ($\bar{X}$) for population mean ($\mu$), sample variance ($S^2$) for population variance ($\sigma^2$)) [3, 4]. Point estimates are often not very reliable on their own [5]
  - **Confidence Interval Estimate**: An interval or range of values [3]. Confidence intervals are a more accurate representation of reality and are preferred for making inferences because they provide more information [4, 6]
- **Properties of Estimators**:
  - **Unbiased Estimator**: An estimator whose expected value is equal to the population parameter [7]. For example, the sample mean ($\bar{X}$) is an unbiased estimator of the population mean ($\mu$) [8]
  - **Efficient Estimator**: An estimator with the least variability of outcomes (i.e., the smallest variance) [8, 9]
- **Statistic vs. Estimator**: "Statistic" is a broader term; a point estimate is a type of statistic [9]
