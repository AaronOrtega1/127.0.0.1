- Works for Classic Load Balancers, [[1749061609-application-load-balancer-(alb)|ALB]], and [[1749583045-network-load-balancer-(nlb)|NLB]].
- The "cookie" used for stickiness has and expiration date you control, NLB work without the cookie.
- Enabling this may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.
