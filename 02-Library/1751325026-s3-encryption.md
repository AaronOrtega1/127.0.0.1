# S3 Encryption
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### Object Encryption
- You can encrypt objects in S3 buckets using one of 4 methods
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**
  - With Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) - Enabled by Default.
  - With KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).
  - With Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
- **Client-Side Encryption**

#### S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- Keys handled, managed and owned by AWS.
- Server-Side.
- Encryption type is **AES-256**.
- Must set header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**
- Enabled by default for new buckets and new objects.

#### SSE-KMS
- Keys handled and managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
- KMS advantages: user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail.
- Server-Side.
- Must set header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"**

##### KMS Limitation.
- When you upload, it calls the **GenerateDataKey** KMS API.
- When you download, it calls the **Decrypt** KMS API.
- Count towards the KMS quoata per second (5,500, 10,000, 30,000 req/s based on region).
- You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console.

#### SSE-C
- Server-Side Encryption using keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS.
- Amazon S3 does **NOT** store the encryption key you provide.
- **HTTPS must be used.**
- Key must be provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made.

#### Client-Side Encryption
- Use client libraries such as **Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library**.
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to Amazon S3.
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from Amazon S3.
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle.

#### Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
- Amazon S3 exposes two endpoints:
  - **HTTP endpoint** - non encrypted.
  - **HTTPS endpoint** - encryption in flight.
- **HTTPS is recommended.**
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C.
- Most clients would use the https endpoints by default.
