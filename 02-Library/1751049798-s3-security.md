# S3 Security
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### How can we get security in our S3 buckets?
- **User-Based**
	- **IAM Policies** - Which **API** calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM.
- **Resource-Based**
	- **Bucket Policies** - bucket wide rules from S3 console - allows cross account.
	- **Object Access Control List (ACL)** - finer grain (can be disabled).
	- **Bucket Access Control List (ACL)** - less common (can be disabled).

>[!info] Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
>- The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy allows it AND there's no explicit DENY.

- **Encryption:** encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys.
### S3 Bucket Policies

^3c570e

- JSON based policies
	- Resources: buckets and objects.
	- Effect: Allow/Deny.
	- Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny.
	- Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to.
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
	- Grant public access to the bucket.
	- Force objects to be encrypted at upload.
	- Grant access to another account (Cross Account).

### Block Public Access
- If the bucket should never be public, leave these on. Created to prevent company data leaks.
