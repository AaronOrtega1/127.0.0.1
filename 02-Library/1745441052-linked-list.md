# Linked List
## Summary
- A linked list consists of a [[1760038325-node|Node]] with data, and a pointer to the next node.
- It's similar to an array but it has some key benefits:
	- Isn't stored continuously in memory.
	- When a node is added or removed the rest of the nodes don't need to be shifted.

## Key Ideas
- A linked list consists of nodes with some sort of data, and a pointer to the next node.

- A big benefit with using linked lists is that nodes are stored wherever the is free space in memory. Another benefit is that when a node is remove or added the rest of the nodes don't need to be shifted.
