### Differences
### EBS
- One instance (except multi-attach io1/io2)
- Locked at the [[1747858683-aws-availability-zone|AZ]] level.
- gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases.
- gp3 & io1: increase IO independently.

- Root EBS volumes of instances get terminated my default if the [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] instance gets terminated. (can be disabled)
### EFS
- Mounting 100s of instances across AZ.
- EFS share website files (WordPress).
- **Only for Linux Instances** (POSIX).
- Has a higher price point than EBS.
- Can leverage Storage Tiers for cost savings.
