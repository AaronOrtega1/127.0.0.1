# Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing
When making a decision based on hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur [13].

|x|$H_0$ is True (e.g., She doesn't like you)|$H_0$ is False (e.g., She likes you)|
|---|---|---|
|**Accept $H_0$** (e.g., Do nothing)|**Correct Decision** [44]|**Type II Error ($\beta$)** [16, 45] (False Negative - missed opportunity)|
|**Reject $H_0$** (e.g., Ask her out)|**Type I Error ($\alpha$)** [13, 46] (False Positive - embarrassment)|**Correct Decision ($1-\beta$)** [46, 47] (Power of the Test)|

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**:
    
    - Occurs when you **reject a true null hypothesis** [13].
        
    - The probability of making this error is denoted by **$\alpha$ (the significance level)** [13].
        
    - The researcher is responsible for this error, as they choose $\alpha$ [16].
        
    - **Example**: Asking someone out when they don't like you back (false positive) [46].
        
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**:
    
    - Occurs when you **accept a false null hypothesis** [16].
        
    - The probability of making this error is denoted by **$\beta$** [16].
        
    - $\beta$ is influenced by factors like sample size and the magnitude of the effect being studied [16].
        
    - **Example**: Not asking someone out when they actually like you (lost opportunity) [45].
        
- **Power of the Test**:
    
    - The probability of **rejecting a false null hypothesis** [47].
        
    - Calculated as $1 - \beta$ [47].
        
    - This is the **researcher's goal** [47].
        
    - The power of a test can often be increased by **increasing the sample size** [47, 48].
