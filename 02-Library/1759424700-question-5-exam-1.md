# Question 5
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
A pharma company is working on developing a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. The researchers at the company want to process the reference healthcare data in a highly available as well as HIPAA compliant in-memory database that supports caching results of SQL queries.

As a solutions architect, which of the following AWS services would you recommend for this task?

**My Answer:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis/Memcached
**Correct Answer:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis/Memcached
## Root Cause Analysis
**Why This Was the Right Choice:**
- I mentioned in-memory data base that supports caching, and ElastiCache was the only logical option between them all (Amazon DocumentDB, Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), Amazon ElastiCache for Redis/Memcached, Amazon DynamoDB)
## Core Concepts Tested
- [[1750285055-elasticache-overview|ElastiCache]]

**Key Keywords I Identified Correctly:**
- **"HIPAA compliant"** -> both Redis and Memcached are eligible.
- **"in-memory database"** -> 
- **"supports caching results"** -> Caching frequent accessed data.
## Why the Correct Answer Works
- Redis and Memcached are both in-memory databases, with caching capabilities and HIPAA compliant.
