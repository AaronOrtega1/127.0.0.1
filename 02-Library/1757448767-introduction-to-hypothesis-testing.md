# Introduction to Hypothesis Testing
- **Prerequisites**: To fully grasp hypothesis testing, it's beneficial to have a prior understanding of confidence intervals, distributions (including normal and t-distributions), Z-tables, and T-tables [1].
    
- **Purpose**: While confidence intervals provide an estimation of where population parameters are located, hypothesis testing offers a definitive "yes or no" answer, which is crucial for decision-making [1, 2].
    
- **Four Steps in Data-Driven Decision Making** [2]:
    
    1. **Formulate a hypothesis**.
        
    2. **Find the right test** for your hypothesis.
        
    3. **Execute the test**.
        
    4. **Make a decision** based on the result.
        

### 1.1 What is a Hypothesis?

- A hypothesis is fundamentally **an idea or a statement that can be tested** [3].
    
- It becomes testable when you have something specific to compare it with. For example, "apples in New York are expensive" becomes a testable hypothesis if "expensive" is defined as "any price higher than $1.75 per pound" [3].
    
- **What cannot be a statistical hypothesis?** An idea that lacks empirical data for testing. For instance, comparing the future performance of administrations where data does not yet exist cannot be a statistical hypothesis. However, comparing past administrations for which data is available can be [4].
    

### 1.2 Formulating Hypotheses: Null and Alternative

In statistical testing, two main hypotheses are formulated [5]:

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**:
    
    - This is the statement that is **to be tested** [5].
        
    - It represents the **status quo** or the current belief [6, 7].
        
    - It's similar to the legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty"; we assume the null hypothesis is true until there is sufficient statistical evidence to prove otherwise [8].
        
    - Generally, the researcher is **trying to reject** the null hypothesis [6, 7].
        
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_A$)**:
    
    - This covers **everything else** not stated in the null hypothesis [5].
        
    - It often represents the **change or innovation** that challenges the status quo [6].
        
    - It can also represent the researcher's personal opinion or the outcome they are trying to prove [7].
        

#### 1.2.1 Examples of Hypothesis Formulation

- **Two-Sided (or Two-Tailed) Test**: Used when you are interested in whether a parameter is simply _different_ from a hypothesized value (either greater or smaller) [9].
    
    - **Example**: Testing if the mean data scientist salary in the US is $113,000 [5, 8].
        
        - $H_0: \text{mean salary} = $113,000$ [8]
            
        - $H_1: \text{mean salary} \neq $113,000$ [8]
            
- **One-Sided (or One-Tailed) Test**: Used when you are interested in whether a parameter is specifically _greater than_ or _less than_ a hypothesized value [9].
    
    - **Example 1**: Testing if data scientists earn _more than_ $125,000 (Paul's claim, which is the status quo being challenged) [6, 9].
        
        - $H_0: \text{mean salary} \geq $125,000$ [9]
            
        - $H_1: \text{mean salary} < $125,000$ [9]
            
    - **Example 2**: Testing if the average GPA of students is _lower than_ 70% [10].
        
        - $H_0: \mu \leq 70%$ [10]
            
        - $H_1: \mu > 70%$ [10]
            
- **Important Note**: The outcomes of statistical tests refer to the **population parameter**, not just the sample statistic [6].
