# Box Model CSS
## Summary
![[1761848999-box-model-css.webp|300]]

- The box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element.
  - It has **width** and **height**.
  - **Padding** is the space inside the border of a element.
  - **Margin** is the space that separates each element from each other.
  - **Border** is what delimits the space that each elements takes.
    - The three properties above can be define in 3 possible ways.

### How to define padding, margin and border
```CSS
HTML_ELEMENT {
  border: 10px solid;
  padding: 10px 5px 12px 20px;
  margin: 12px 10px;
}
```

- The first one is the easiest it just gives one value to all 4 sides of the element.
- The second one gives specific values to each size of the box, starting from top, then right, then bottom and finally left, making a circle clockwise.
- Finally the third one gives a specific value to the top and bottom sides, and another value to the right and left sides.
