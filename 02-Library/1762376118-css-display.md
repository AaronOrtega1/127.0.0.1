# CSS Display
## Summary
- By default all elements have the **block property**, that gives a full width to each elements.
- **Inline property**, puts all the elements that have this property in a single line until they no longer fit in the screen width and then it send some to the next line. (We cannot set the width and height of each element.)
```CSS
element {
  display: inline;
}
```
- **inline-block property**, allows us to set the height and width, while the elements stay in the same line.
```CSS
element {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
- **none property**, used when you want to make a element dissapear.
```CSS
element {
  display: none;
}
```
