# S3 CORS
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### What is CORS?
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- Origin = scheme (protocol) + hots (domain + port).
- **Web Browser** based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin.
- Same origin: **http://example.com/app1** and **http://example.com/app2**.
- Different origin: **http://www.example.com** and **http://other.example.com**.
- The request won't be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using **CORS Headers** (ex:**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**).

### CORS
- If a client makes a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers.
- You can allow for a specific origin or for * (all origins).
