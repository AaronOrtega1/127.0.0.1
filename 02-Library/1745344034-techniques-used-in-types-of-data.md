	- **Data Collection**
	- **Data Pre-Processing**:
		- Used to take the raw data into useful information, with a group of operations that convert it.
			- **Class Labeling**:
				- Numerical, can be manipulated with math.
				- Categorical, just gives information and cannot be manipulated with math.
			- **Data Cleansing**:
				- Aims to deal with inconsistent data.
			- **Dealing With Missing Values.**
		- Aims to fix the problems that can happens with data gather.
	- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER).
	- Relational Schema.
- With big data we use:
	- **Data collection and data pre-processing** are an essential part of big data, and are pretty similar to the traditional ones except for:
		- **Class Labeling** counts with many more labels.
		- **Data Cleansing** different approaches since there are many types of data.
		- **Dealing With Missing Values** also has a different approaches to missing values, each depending of the data that is being dealt with.
