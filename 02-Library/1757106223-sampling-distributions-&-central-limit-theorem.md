# Sampling Distributions & Central Limit Theorem
## 3. Sampling Distributions & Central Limit Theorem

### 3.1 Sampling Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution formed by taking many, many samples from a population and calculating a statistic (e.g., the mean) from each sample [32, 33]
- **Sampling Distribution of the Mean**: The means from these multiple samples will vary but tend to concentrate around the true population mean [33]. The average of these sample means is expected to be a very precise approximation of the population mean [34]

### 3.2 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- **Core Statement**: Regardless of the original population's distribution (normal, binomial, uniform, exponential, etc.), the **sampling distribution of the mean will approximate a normal distribution** as long as the sample size is sufficiently large [35]
  - **Mean of Sampling Distribution**: Equal to the population mean ($\mu$) [35]
  - **Variance of Sampling Distribution**: Equal to the population variance ($\sigma^2$) divided by the sample size ($N$) [36]
- **Condition**: The CLT typically applies when the sample size ($N$) is at least 30 observations [36]
- **Importance**: The CLT is a fundamental concept because it allows statisticians to use the powerful and elegant properties of the normal distribution for hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations, even when the original population is not normally distributed [37]. It revolutionized the field of statistics [37]

### 3.3 Standard Error
- **Definition**: The **standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean** [38, 39]. It quantifies the variability of sample means [39]
- **Formula**:
  $$ \text{Standard Error} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} $$
  Where:
  - $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation [39]
  - $N$ is the sample size [39]
- **Significance**: The standard error indicates how well a sample mean approximates the true population mean [40]
- **Relationship with Sample Size**: As the sample size ($N$) increases, the standard error decreases [40]. This means larger samples provide a better and more precise approximation of the population mean [40]
