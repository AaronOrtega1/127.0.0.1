# Measures of Central Tendency
- These measures help summarize the typical value or center of a data set [39].
- **Mean (Simple Average)**:
    - Denoted by $\mu$ for a population and $\bar{X}$ for a sample [39].
    - Calculation: Sum of all components divided by their number [40].
    - **Downside**: Highly susceptible to **outliers** (extreme values) [40, 41].
- **Median**:
    - The **middle number in an ordered data set** [41].
    - Calculation:
        1.  Order the data in ascending order [42].
        2.  Position = $\frac{n+1}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of observations [42].
        3.  If $n$ is odd, the median is the value at this position.
        4.  If $n$ is even (position is X.5), the median is the average of the two middle numbers [43].
    - **Advantage**: Not affected by extreme values or outliers [43].
- **Mode**:
    - The **value that occurs most often** in a data set [43].
    - Can be used for both numerical and categorical data [43].
    - A data set can have multiple modes (e.g., bimodal, trimodal) [44]. If every value appears only once, there is no mode [45].
- **Usage**: No single "best" measure; mean, median, and mode should be **used together** to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data set [44]. Using only one measure is considered the worst approach [44].
