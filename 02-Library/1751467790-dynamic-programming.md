# Dynamic Programming
- Many different variations and [[1751467918-nuances|nuances]] to the problems that fall under this category.
- Typically involve optimizing a solution by breaking it down into overlapping sub problems, storing the results of these sub problems and reusing them to avoid redundant computations.
- Two major ways of doing it:
  - **Top-Down**: Start from the top an recursively solve the sub-problems, storing the results to avoid solving the same sub-problem multiple times.
  - **Bottom-Up**: Solve the smallest sub-problems first and use the solutions to build up to the solution of the bigger problem. Instead of recursion, typically involves filling a table, where each entry represents the solution to a smaller sub-problem.
