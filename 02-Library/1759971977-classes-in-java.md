# Classes in Java
## Summary
- A `class` is what is used to create specific object, it's not quite the object but its used to build it.
	- Ex. a cookie cutter, it is not a cookie, but it's used to make cookies.
```java
public class Cookie {
  private String color;

  public Cookie(String color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

  public void setColor(String color) {
	this.color = color;
  }
}
```
