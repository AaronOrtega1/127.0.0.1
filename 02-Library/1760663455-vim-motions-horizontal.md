# Vim Motions Horizontal
- `_` moves cursor to the first char in the line. `$` moves to the end of the line.
- `f` searches forward and places the cursors on top of a char, while `F` searches backwards
- `t` works to search forward a char but places the cursor one before, and `T` searches backwards a char but places the cursor on after.
	- `t(` -> would place me one before the `(`.
	- def function_tes**t**():
- To repeat a search you use `,` to go backwards and `;` to go forward.
