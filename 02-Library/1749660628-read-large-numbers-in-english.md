# Read Large Numbers In English
## **Basic Rules**
1. **Group digits in sets of 3** (from the right):  
   - e.g., `12,345,678` → `12` (million) `345` (thousand) `678` (units).
2. **Read each group + place value** (thousand/million/billion).  
3. **Hyphens (-)** for numbers 21–99 (e.g., "thirty-**four**").  
4. **No plural "s"** (e.g., "two million" ✅, "two millions" ❌).

| Feature    | British English                     | American English         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **"And"**  | "One hundred **and** five" (105)    | "One hundred five" (105) |
| **Zeroes** | "Two thousand **and** five" (2,005) | "Two thousand five"      |

## **Examples**
| Number           | How to Read It                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| **10,000**       | Ten thousand                    |
| **100,000**      | One hundred thousand            |

## **Common Mistakes**
- ❌ "Two millions" → ✅ "Two million"  
- ❌ "One hundred-five" → ✅ "One hundred **and** five" (UK) / "One hundred five" (US)  
- ❌ "Twelve thousand and thirty four" → ✅ "Twelve thousand **thirty-four**" (hyphen!)

## **Quick Reference**
- **1,000** = Thousand  
- **1,000,000** = Million  
- **1,000,000,000** = Billion  
- **1,000,000,000,000** = Trillion  

> **Tip:** Practice by reading prices, population stats, or years (e.g., "World population: 8,019,876,189").
