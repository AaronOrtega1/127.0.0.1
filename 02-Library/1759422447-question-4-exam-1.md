# Question 4
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
A financial services company is looking to move its on-premises IT infrastructure to AWS Cloud. The company has multiple long-term server bound licenses across the application stack and the CTO wants to continue to utilize those licenses while moving to AWS.

As a solutions architect, which of the following would you recommend as the MOST cost-effective solution?

**My Answer:** Use Amazon EC2 dedicated hosts
**Correct Answer:** Use Amazon EC2 dedicated hosts

**Key Keywords I Identified Correctly:**
- **"long-term server bound licenses"** -> requires dedicated hardware

- **"financial services"** -> implies expensive, compliance-sensitive licenses
## Why the Correct Answer Works
- **License Compliance:** Dedicated Hosts provide physical server consistency required by server-bound licenses
