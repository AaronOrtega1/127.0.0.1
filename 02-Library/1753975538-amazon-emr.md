# Amazon EMR
## Summary
- 

## Key Ideas
### What is EMR?
- Stands for "Elastic MapReduce".
- Helps creating **Hadoop clusters (Big Data)** to analyze and process vast amount of data.
- The clusters can be made of **hundreds of [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] instances.**
- Comes bundled with Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink...
- EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration.
- Auto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances.
- **Use cases:** data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data...

### Node types & purchasing.
- **Master Node:** Manage the cluster, coordinate, manage health - long running.
- **Core Node:** Run tasks and store data - long running.
- **Task Node (optional):** Just to run tasks - usually Spot.
- **Purchasing options:**
  - On-demand: reliable, predictable, won't be terminated.
  - Reserved (min 1 year): cost saving (EMR will automatically use if available).
  - Spot Instances: cheaper, can be terminated, less reliable.
- Can have long-running cluster, or transient (temporary) cluster.
