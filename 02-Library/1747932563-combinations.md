# Combinations
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### What are combinations?
- Number of different ways we can pick certain elements of a set.
### Why we use combinations instead of **variations**?
- Because variations don't take into account double counting elements.
- "All the different [[1747851525-permutations|Permutations]] of a single **combination** are different **variations**"
	- This reference that if we take a sample form a set (Alex, Sarah, Dave) it doesn't matter in which order we take them out, since any of the 6 permutations we can make is a different variation, but **NOT** a different combination.
### Notation and Formula
- Permutations
$$
P_3=n!
$$
- Combination.
$$
C_p^n=\frac{V_p^n}{P_p}
$$
- After using the formula associated with [[1747851525-permutations|Permutations]] and **variations**.
$$

C_p^n=\frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}
$$
