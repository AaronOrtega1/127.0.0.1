## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### 
- You can restrict who can access your distribution
  - **Allowlist:** allows access to users if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
  - **Blocklist:** prevent access to users if they're in one of the countries on a list of banned countries.
- The "country" is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP db.
