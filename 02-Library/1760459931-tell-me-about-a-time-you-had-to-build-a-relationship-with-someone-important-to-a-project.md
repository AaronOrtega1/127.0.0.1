# Tell me about a time you had to build a relationship with someone important to a project
## Situation
In my previous role as a Software Developer intern I was tasked to work as the left hand of one of the developer of a company that had requested the services of the company I used to work for to develop their web page.
## Task
My task was to help her with developing the frontend for some new requirements she was working on.
## Action
I had some meeting with her, in which I asked her if she could walk me through the project to familiarize myself with their way to implement things, I looked at the company to understand what they did and how they wanted things done. I then proceeded to develop the frontend of the requirements that we were working on, I had to get approval for my work from one of the owners of the company, and main developer of that company and from her before I could make a pull request.
## Result
As a result of my way of working and communication the client was satisfied with the delivered code and approved my pull requests.
