# Amazon MQ
## Summary
- [[1751940872-amazon-sqs-overview|SQS]], [[1751991519-amazon-simple-notification-system-sns|SNS]] are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS.
- Traditional apps may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS.
- When migrating to the cloud instead of re-engineering the app we can use Amazon MQ.
- Is a managed message broker service for:
  - RabbitMQ.
  - ActiveMQ.
- Doesn't "scale" as much as SQS/SNS.
- Runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover.
- Has both queue feature (SQS) and topic feature (SNS).

### High Availability.
