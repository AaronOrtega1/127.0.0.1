# Number of Islands
- Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '`1`'s (land) and '`0`'s (water), return the number of islands.
- An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Desired Outcome
- **Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
- **Output:** 1

## My Solution
1. 

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        

```
