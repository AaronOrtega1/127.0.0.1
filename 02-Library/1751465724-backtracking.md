# Backtracking
- Extension of [[1751431852-depth-first-search|DFS]].
- You often have to build the solution tree yourself.
- You explore all possible solution by making a series of decisions, each decision represents a node and each potential decision represents a branch.
- As you explore possible solutions you either, reach a valid solution or hit a dead end, when a decision hits a dead end you back track to the previous decision, undo it and try another path.
- Use case: [[]]
