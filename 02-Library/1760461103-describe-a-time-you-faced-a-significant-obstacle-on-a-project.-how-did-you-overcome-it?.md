# Describe a time you faced a significant obstacle on a project. How did you overcome it?
## Situation
During my IoT class our project was to make a working IoT device and to make a web interface in which the user could see the data that the device was capturing. In my team there were 2 member from Business Engineering that worked on the business model of the project and a friend of mine and I, both from CSE, we didn't have anyone with electronics knowledge that could work on the device itself.
## Task
My task was to work on the device and make the frontend of the web page to display the data.
## Action
I learned how to weld by seeing a YT tutorial and asking for some other students that were in the electronics room for advice and welded the electronic components, I check that they worked correctly and that we where capturing the data that we wanted correctly. I then had to make a simple web page with a landing page, a login and sign up page, the dashboard only accesible if you where login with all the metrics of the device and a button that directed you to a new page in which you could register a new device, for this I had to read the documentation of the broker that we where using to use their API and send the required data.
## Result
As a result we delivered a functional dog feeder, that measured the weight of the dish to observe if it was empty and fill it with a certain amount of dog food from an automatic dispenser, and with a proximity sensor to check if the dog was eating.
