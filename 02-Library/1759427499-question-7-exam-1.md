# Question 7
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
A company wants to store business-critical data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes which provide persistent storage independent of Amazon EC2 instances. During a test run, the development team found that on terminating an Amazon EC2 instance, the attached Amazon EBS volume was also lost, which was contrary to their assumptions.

As a solutions architect, could you explain this issue?

**My Answer:** The Amazon EBS volume was configured as the root volume of Amazon EC2 instance. On termination of the instance, the default behavior is to also terminate the attached root volume

**Correct Answer:** The Amazon EBS volume was configured as the root volume of Amazon EC2 instance. On termination of the instance, the default behavior is to also terminate the attached root volume
