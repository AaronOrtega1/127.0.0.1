# Question 7
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
A company wants to store business-critical data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes which provide persistent storage independent of Amazon EC2 instances. During a test run, the development team found that on terminating an Amazon EC2 instance, the attached Amazon EBS volume was also lost, which was contrary to their assumptions.

As a solutions architect, could you explain this issue?

**My Answer:** The Amazon EBS volume was configured as the root volume of Amazon EC2 instance. On termination of the instance, the default behavior is to also terminate the attached root volume

**Correct Answer:** The Amazon EBS volume was configured as the root volume of Amazon EC2 instance. On termination of the instance, the default behavior is to also terminate the attached root volume
## Root Cause Analysis
**Why This Was the Right Choice:** It's a core concept of mounting [[1748622252-ebs-overview|EBS]] volumes into [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]], if the volume is mounted as the root by default if the instance is terminated the volume will be terminated also.
## Core Concepts Tested
- [[1748622252-ebs-overview|EBS]]

## Why the Correct Answer Works
- Because root EBS volumes attached to an instances, once that instance is terminated the volume will be deleted.
