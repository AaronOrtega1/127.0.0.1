# Visualizing Data
### Visualizing Categorical Data
- Visualizing data is crucial for interpretation [12].
- **Frequency Distribution Tables**:
    - Two columns: Category and its corresponding frequency (e.g., car brands and units sold) [13].
- **Bar Charts (Column Charts)**:
    - Vertical axis shows numerical frequency (e.g., units sold); horizontal axis shows different categories [14].
    - Provides a clear visual comparison of categories [14].
- **Pie Charts**:
    - Shows the **relative frequency** (percentage of the total) for each category [15].
    - Useful for comparing items and seeing their share of the total (e.g., market share) [15].
- **Pareto Diagrams**:
    - A special type of bar chart where categories are shown in **descending order of frequency** [16, 17].
    - Includes a **curve** on the same graph representing the **cumulative frequency** [17].
        - Cumulative frequency: The sum of relative frequencies, starting from the first category and accumulating to 100% [17, 18].
        - Measured by a separate vertical axis on the right [18].
    - Combines strengths of bar and pie charts, allowing comparison between categories and as part of the total [18].
    - Can illustrate the **Pareto principle (80/20 rule)**, where 80% of effects come from 20% of causes [19].

### Visualizing Numerical Data
- **Frequency Distribution Tables for Numerical Data**:
    - When dealing with many unique numerical values, it's more practical to group data into **intervals** [20].
    - **Interval Width**: Calculated as $\frac{\text{Largest Number} - \text{Smallest Number}}{\text{Number of Desired Intervals}}$ [21, 22]. Round up for a cleaner representation [22].
    - Statisticians generally prefer 5 to 20 intervals [21].
    - A number is included in an interval if it's greater than the lowest bound and equal to or less than the largest bound [22, 23].
    - Includes columns for Interval, Absolute Frequency, and **Relative Frequency** [23, 24].
- **Histograms**:
    - The most common graph for **numerical data** [25].
    - Vertical axis: Numerical, showing absolute frequency [25].
    - Horizontal axis: Numerical, showing intervals [25].
    - Each bar's width equals the interval width, and its height equals the frequency [26].
    - **Bars touch** to indicate continuity between intervals, unlike bar charts for categorical data [26].
    - Can also use relative frequency on the vertical axis [26, 27].
    - Can be created with unequal intervals (e.g., age groups), but equal-width intervals are recommended for beginners [27, 28].

### Visualizing Relationships Between Two Variables
- **Cross Tables (Contingency Tables)**:
    - Used to represent relationships between **two categorical variables** [29].
    - Shows rows for one variable and columns for another, with counts or allocations in the cells (e.g., investor allocations across asset classes) [30].
    - Row and column totals are useful for further analysis [30, 31].
- **Side-by-Side Bar Charts**:
    - A variation of bar chart used to visualize cross-table data [31].
    - For each category of one variable, the categories of the second variable are represented by adjacent bars [32].
    - Facilitates comparison within and between groups [32].
- **Scatter Plots**:
    - Used to represent **two numerical variables** [33].
    - X-axis for one variable, Y-axis for the other (e.g., reading SAT scores vs. writing SAT scores) [33, 34].
    - Each point represents an observation [35].
    - Interpretation focuses on the overall pattern and distribution rather than individual points [35].
    - Can reveal:
        - **Uptrends (positive relationships)**: Lower scores in one variable correlate with lower scores in the other, and vice versa [35, 36].
        - **Concentrations**: Areas where many data points cluster (e.g., average scores) [36, 37].
        - **Outliers**: Observations that deviate significantly from the general pattern (e.g., a student with high reading but low writing scores) [37, 38].
