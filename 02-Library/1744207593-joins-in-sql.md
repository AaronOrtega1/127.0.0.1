### Left Join
- Brings everything from our left table **(employee_demographics)** and only bring what has a match to our join specification in the right table **(employee_salary)**

## Right Join
- Take everything from our right table **(employee_salary)** and if there are not fields in the left table **(employee_demographics)** it will put all the values as `NULL`.
