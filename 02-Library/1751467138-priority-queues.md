# Priority Queues
- Used for question related to something with "K" (Kth, Top K, K Closest).
- The most common implementations of priority queues are **heaps**.
- A heap is a especial type of tree that is organized in a specific type of way.
  - **Min Heap**: The smallest value is always at the top, and each parent is smaller than its children. We use it to get **K largest** values.
  - **Max Heap**: The biggest value is always at the top, and each parent is bigger than its children. We use it to get **K smallest** values.
- Allow for efficient access to the **smallest or largest value in O(1) time** and **inserting or removing elements take O(log n)**.
