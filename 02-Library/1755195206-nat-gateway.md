# NAT Gateway
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### 
- Better than [[1755194320-nat-instance|NAT Instance]].
- AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration.
- Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth.
- NATGW is created in a specific [[1747858683-aws-availability-zone|AZ]], uses and Elastic IP.
- Can't be used by [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] instances in the same subnet (only from other subnets).
- Requires and IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW).
- 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps.
- No security groups to manage/required.

### High Availability
- **NAT Gateway is resilient within a single AZ.**
- Must create **multiple NAT Gateways** in **multiple AZs** for fault-tolerance.
- There is no cross-AZ failover needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT.
