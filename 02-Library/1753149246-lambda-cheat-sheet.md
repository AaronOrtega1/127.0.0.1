# Lambda Cheat Sheet
**Key Features:**
- Serverless compute service
- Pay per request and compute time
- Automatic scaling
- Supports multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Event-driven architecture

**Important Concepts:**
- Cold starts: Initial latency when function hasn't been used
- Concurrency limit: Default 1000 concurrent executions
- Execution context: Temporary runtime environment
- Layers: Share code/libraries across functions
- Destinations: Asynchronous invocation results routing

**Use Cases:**
- Event processing
- Data transformation
- Backends for mobile/web apps
- Automated tasks
