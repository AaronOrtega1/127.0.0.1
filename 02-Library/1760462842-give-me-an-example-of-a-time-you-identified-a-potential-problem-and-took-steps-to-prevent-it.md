# Give me an example of a time you identified a potential problem and took steps to prevent it
## Situation
During my previous position I was assign as leader of a small team of interns that just had joined the company to check their activities and help them, they were assign in the optimization of a project that the company was working on, they work consistent primarily in going through the web page and check if the SEO was optimized, if the whole page was responsive and if something wasn't displaying correctly to make it responsive, check that all the menus worked correctly in both the computer and in a mobile device and again fix it if it wasn't working.
## Task
My task was to assign them their task in the software that the company used, to solve any doubt or problem that they encountered during their activities and finally to review their pull request and accept them or to give feedback if necessary.
## Action
I looked through the page and divided it into small task for each part, I created each task and progressively assigned some to them, when we first had a meeting to meet eachother I told them that if anyone had any problems or any doubts they could contact me and I would gladly help them, and if it was out of my scope I would scale it so someone else could help us. I made them a little docker cheatsheet for them to know how to get the local environment running, I organized weekly meeting to see progress and to discuss any unsolved problems, and also I regularly updated my direct supervisor on the progress of the project.
## Result
As a result we managed to finish the project and deliver an improved version of the web app to the company, giving the company the chance to launch a new product to attract more customer into using their services.
