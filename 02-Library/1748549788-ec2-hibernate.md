# EC2 Hibernate
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### What does the hibernate state does?
- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved.
- The instance boot is much faster. (the OS is not stopped/restarted)
- Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume.
- The root EBS volume must be encrypted.
### Use cases
- Long-running processing.
- Saving the RAM state.
- Services that take time to initialize.
