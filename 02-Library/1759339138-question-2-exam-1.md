# Question 2
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
The DevOps team at an IT company is provisioning a two-tier application in a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet. The team wants to use either a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance or a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway in the public subnet to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet but needs some technical assistance in terms of the configuration options available for the Network Address Translation (NAT) instance and the Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.

As a solutions architect, which of the following options would you identify as CORRECT? (Select three)

**My Answer:** NAT instances can be used as bastion server, *Security Groups can be associated with a NAT gateway*, NAT instance supports port forwarding.

**Correct Answer:** NAT instances can be used as bastion server, *Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance*, NAT instance supports port forwarding.

- Forgot that [[1748283223-security-groups-&-classic-ports-overview|Security Groups]] cannot be attach to NAT gateways, so this contradicts the specifications.

## Why My Answer Was Wrong
- According to the documentation:
	- Security Groups cannot be associated with a NAT gateway. The security group can be associated to the resources behind the NAT Gateway to control inbound and outbound traffic.
