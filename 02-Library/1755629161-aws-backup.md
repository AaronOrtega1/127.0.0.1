### Features
#### Backup Scope
- **Cross-Region Backups**: Store in another region for **Disaster Recovery**.
- **Cross-Account Backups**: Centralized strategy across multiple AWS accounts.

#### Backup Operations
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: Supported for services like Aurora.
- **On-Demand Backups**: Manual, ad-hoc.
- **Scheduled Backups**: Automated with backup plans.
- **Tag-Based Policies**: Only back up resources tagged with criteria (e.g., `production`).

#### Backup Plans
- Define backup strategy including:
  - **Frequency**: e.g., every 12 hours, weekly, monthly, custom cron.
  - **Backup Window**: When backups should run.
  - **Transition to Cold Storage**: Move to long-term storage after days/weeks/months/years.
  - **Retention Period**: How long to keep backups (days → years → forever).

### Storage
- Backups stored in **internal Amazon S3 buckets** managed by AWS Backup (not visible directly to user).

### Security: Vault Lock
- **Vault Lock** enforces **WORM policy** (Write Once, Read Many).
- Guarantees immutability of backups:
  - Backups **cannot be deleted** once locked.
  - Protects against accidental/malicious deletes or altered retention.
  - Even the **root user** cannot delete backups once Vault Lock is active.
- Provides **regulatory compliance** and **strong safety guarantees**.

### Key Takeaways (Exam Focus)
- AWS Backup = **centralized backup management**.
- Supports **cross-region, cross-account**, and **PITR**.
- **Backup Plans** define frequency, window, cold storage, retention.
- **Vault Lock = immutability** with WORM policy.
- Covers most AWS storage, database, and file system services.
