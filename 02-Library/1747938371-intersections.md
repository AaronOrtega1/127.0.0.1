# Intersections
## Summary
- When to events happen at the same time is a **intersection**.
	- $A\cap B$
- When there isn't a single case that the events happen at the same time is when:
	- $A\cap B = \emptyset$
## Key Ideas
### When we want two events to happen at the same time what are we talking about?
- We are talking about their *intersection*.
$$A \cap B$$
### Examples
- The intersection of all hearts and all diamonds is the EMPTY SET.

$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$
	- There are no outcomes which satisfy both events.
- Intersection of all diamonds and all queens.

$$A \cap B = Q\ Diamonds$$
- Intersection of all red cards and all diamonds.
