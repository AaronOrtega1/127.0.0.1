# Question 1
## Question Details
**Original Question:**
A cyber security company is running a mission critical application using a single Spread placement group of Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs 15 Amazon EC2 instances for optimal performance.

How many Availability Zones (AZs) will the company need to deploy these Amazon EC2 instances per the given use-case?

**My Answer:** 15 AZs
**Correct Answer:** 3 AZs
## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue:** [[1759337372-misreading-the-question|Misreading the Question]]
- Superficial reading: Saw "15 instances" and reflexively answered "15 AZs"
- **Critical miss:** Failed to recall the 7-instance-per-AZ limit for Spread Placement Groups
## Core Concepts Tested
- [[1748376519-ec2-placement-groups#^Spread|EC2 Placement Groups]]

**Key Keywords I Missed:**
- "Mission critical" -> implies maximum fault tolerance.
- **"Single Spread placement group"** -> specific rules apply.
- "15 instances" -> triggers limit calculation
## Why the Correct Answer Works?
- Because with spread placement groups for [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] instances we can have up to 7 instances in each [[1747858683-aws-availability-zone|AZ]].
## Why My Answer Was Wrong?
- I'm saying that we need 15 AZ one for each instance, which is impossible since most regions have only 3-6 AZs total.
