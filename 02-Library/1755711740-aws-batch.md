# AWS Batch
## Overview
- **AWS Batch**: Fully managed service for **batch processing** at any scale.
- Purpose: Efficiently run **hundreds of thousands of batch jobs** on AWS.
- **Batch job**:
  - Has a **start and end time** (opposite of continuous/streaming jobs)
  - Example: Job starts at 1 a.m. and finishes at 3 a.m.
- Batch automatically **provisions compute resources** (EC2 or Spot Instances) based on workload.

## Key Concepts
1. **Batch Jobs**
   - Defined as:
     - **[[1752020699-docker|Docker]] image**
     - **Task definition** run on [[1752018964-amazon-ecs|ECS]]
   - Anything runnable on **ECS** can run on Batch.
2. **Compute Management**
   - Dynamically launches the **right number of [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] or [[1748304707-spot-instances-&-spot-fleet#^Spot|Spot Instances]].
   - Handles scaling, memory, and CPU provisioning automatically.
   - Reduces **infrastructure management overhead** for users.
3. **Example Workflow**
   - Users upload images to [[1751042472-s3-overview|S3]].
   - **Batch job triggered** to process images.
   - **ECS cluster** composed of EC2/Spot instances created automatically.
   - Docker containers run the processing tasks.
   - Processed images can be stored back in **S3**.

## Comparison with [[1752687705-lambda-overview|Lambda]]
| Feature        | AWS Lambda             | AWS Batch                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime**    | Limited languages      | Any runtime (Docker image)                                      |
| **Time Limit** | 15 minutes             | No time limit                                                   |
| **Storage**    | Limited temporary disk | EC2 storage: [[1748622252-ebs-overview\|EBS]] or instance store |
| **Serverless** | Yes                    | No (managed EC2 instances)                                      |
| **Scaling**    | Automatic              | Automatic, managed by AWS                                       |

## Benefits
- Cost optimization through **auto-scaling EC2/Spot instances**.
- Focus on **job processing**, not infrastructure.
- Supports **large-scale batch workloads**.
- Flexible runtime environment via **Docker containers**.
- Handles high-volume, periodic, or scheduled tasks efficiently.

## Exam Notes
- **Batch jobs** = finite-time tasks, run via **Docker on ECS**.
- Managed EC2 instances handle compute and scaling.
- Best suited for **large-scale batch processing** beyond Lambda limitations.
