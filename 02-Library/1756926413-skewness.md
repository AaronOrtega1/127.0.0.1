# Skewness
- A measure of **asymmetry** in the distribution of a data set [72].
- Indicates whether observations are concentrated on one side [72].
- **Types of Skewness**:
    - **Positive (Right) Skew**:
        - **Mean > Median** [73].
        - Data points are concentrated on the **left side**, with a "tail" extending to the right (outliers are to the right) [73, 74].
        - The mode is the value with the highest frequency [74].
    - **Zero (No) Skew / Symmetrical Distribution**:
        - **Mean = Median = Mode** [74, 75].
        - The frequency of occurrence is completely symmetrical [74].
        - *Self-contained detail (not from sources): The normal distribution is a classic example of a symmetrical distribution with zero skewness.*
    - **Negative (Left) Skew**:
        - **Mean < Median** [75].
        - Outliers are to the **left**, causing the "tail" to extend to the left [75].
        - The mode is the highest point in the distribution [75].
- **Importance**: Skewness helps understand where data is situated and links central tendency measures to probability theory for a more complete data understanding [75, 76].
