### Instance Types
- Check out [this](https://aws.amazon.com/es/ec2/instance-types/) page for deeper info.
#### General Purpose
- Great diversity of workload such as **web servers** or **code repos**.
- Balance between:
	- Compute.
	- Memory.
	- Networking.
- **t2.micro** is a good for free-tier.
#### Compute Optimized
- Great for **compute-intensive** tasks that require **high performance processors**:
	- Batch processing workloads.
	- Media transcoding.
	- High performance web servers.
	- High performance computing (HPC).
	- Scientific modeling & machine learning.
	- Dedicated gaming servers.
#### Memory Optimized
- **Fast performance** for workloads that process large data sets in memory:
	- High performance, relational/non-relational databases.
	- Distributed web scale cache stores
	- In-memory databases optimized for BI ([[Business Intelligence]])
	- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data.
#### Storage Optimized
- Great for storage-intensive task that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage:
	- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
	- Relational & NoSQL databases.
	- Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis).
	- Data warehousing applications.
