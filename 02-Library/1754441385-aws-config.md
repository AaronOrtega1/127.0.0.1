# AWS Config
## Summary
- 

## Key Ideas
### What is AWS Config?
- Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resource.
- Helps record configurations and changes over time.
- Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
  - Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
  - Do my buckets have any public access?
  - How has my [[1749061609-application-load-balancer-(alb)|ALB]] configuration changed over time?
- You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes.
- Per-region service.
- Can be aggregated across regions and accounts.
- Possibility of storing the configuration data into [[1751042472-s3-overview|S3]] (analyzed by [[1753469282-amazon-athena|Athena]]).

### Rules
- Can use AWS managed config rules (over 75).
- Can make custom cofig rules (must be defined in AWS [[1752687705-lambda-overview|Lambda]]).
- Rules can be evaluated/triggered:
  - For each config change.
  - And/or: at regular time intervals.
- **Does not prevent actions from happening (no deny).**
- **Pricing:** no free tier, $0.003 per configuration item recorded per region, $0.001 per config rule evaluation per region.

#### Remediations
- Automate remediation of non-compliant resources using SSM Automation Documents.
- Use AWS-Managed Automation Documents or create custom Automation Documents.
  - Tip: you can create custom Automation Documents that invokes Lambda function.
- You can set **Remediation Retries** if the resource is still non-compliant after auto-remediation.
