# Training Session: [[2025-09-24]]
## Techniques & Drills
### Warm-up
- Started by warming from top to bottom, starting with my neck doing semi circles, then move on to my shoulders moving them in circles forward and backwards, then my rotator cuff with L movements, my wrist with circles outward and inwards, my hip with circles and then moved on to making semi circles with my legs not fully extended, inward and outward, like front kicks swinging my legs one at the time, and finished off with my ankles in circles.

		- Got a submission with a [[1758638740-triangle-choke|Triangle Choke]].

### Live Training/Sparring
- **Notes:** I have to be more careful with not **exposing my arm**, keep them close to me and If I try to attack and fail pull them back. I'm agitating a lot, I have to **stay calm**, breathe and stay relaxed so I don't get all tighten up that also burn energy.

## Key Insights
- Keep calm during fights, breath and relax the body.

## Mistakes & Learnings
- When doing a triangle choke from full guard when I position my leg in my opponents shoulders and I want to tighten up, I should pull my leg down from my shin to avoid injuries by pulling my feet and move my body to the side that I have my leg in my opponents shoulder.
- When I shoot my take downs I have to keep my head looking up.
- When I kick I have to point my foot outward and move my hips also.
- My low kick should be from the top-down, not upwards.

## XP Awarded
- **Striking:** +10 XP
- **Grappling:** +15 XP  
- **Resistance:** +10 XP
