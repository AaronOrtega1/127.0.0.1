# Training Session: [[2025-09-29]]
## Techniques & Drills
### Technical Focus
- We saw ways in which I could have defended in my match in the tournament.
	- The take down:
		- I half committed to the [[1758778235-single-leg|Single Leg Takedown]] that gave my opponent the opportunity to just [[1759208855-sprawl|Sprawl]] and be in a better position.
		- When my opponent sprawled and I couldn't reach his legs I should have to turn into [[1759208947-north-south|North South]] it's still a disadvantageous position but I don't give away my back.
	- The [[1759209097-body-triangle|Body Triangle]] of my opponent:
		- I should aim to rotate so his foot that is holding my body is flat to the ground, this takes away much pressure, I already have to be conscious of which arm my opponent has above in his [[1759209296-seat-belt-grip|Seat Belt Grip]] because I have to turn in the opposite direction.

### Live Training/Sparring
- **Notes:** Had a good match against el caguama, It was more of a flow round in which we both had the opportunity to practice things, look for ways to escape instead of being in a fight to see who would win the match.
