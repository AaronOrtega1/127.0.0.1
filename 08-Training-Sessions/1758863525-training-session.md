# Training Session: [[2025-09-25]]
## Techniques & Drills
### Technical Focus
- Today we saw I different perspective of fighting having a 2 vs 2 in like Muay Thai and then a 2 vs 2 in MMA having the possibility of submitting one person and having a 2 vs 1.
- Then I had a round of BJJ against Tachis, Jacobo and Pato to help me practice continue fighting even through I'm tired.
	- Tachis:
		- Was a light round since Tachis has more of a boxing background but I couldn't pass his guard fast enough and once I passed I had no much time left.
	- Jacobo:
		- Was more of a complicated match where Jacobo submitted me with an [[1758779480-ankle-lock|Ankle Lock]] when I was trying to setup my own, and then I was almost caught in a [[1758652400-armbar|Armbar]] but managed to escape and tried to put him in a [[1758638740-triangle-choke|Triangle Choke]] but was missing a little bit more of stretch in my leg to fully lock it.
	- Pato:
		- Was also a light round where he was mostly in my guard trying to break free and me keeping him locked in.
- Mauro have me some useful tips on [[1758864239-how-to-escape-a-guillotine?|How to escape a guillotine?]]

### Live Training/Sparring
- **Notes:** I'm missing a little bit more of stretch when doing my triangle chokes, but with the tip that Mauro gave me I think that I have it.

## Key Insights
- When going for a triangle imagine you are trying to kick the ceiling before trying to lock the triangle.
- Keep my head close to my opponents torso and looking up when going for a take down to prevent a [[1758864351-guillotine|Guillotine]].
