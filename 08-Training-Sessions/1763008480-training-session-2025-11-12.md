## Techniques & Drills
### Technical Focus
- This class we focused on kicks, we started with low kicks with both legs, and the a simple combination, medium kick -> left hook -> right hook, and then a conditioning exercise ladder from 2 to 4 of right medium kick -> burpees, then the same but with left medium kick -> burpees.

### Live Training/Sparring
- **Notes:** Pato pointed that when I throw a low kick I don't have a solid base putting my whole foot in the ground, and I also noticed that I have to put more of my hips into my kicks.

## Key Insights
- Have a good base when throwing my low kicks by planting my whole foot base in the ground.
- Add more power to my kicks adding more hip movements when throwing the kick.
- I have to get use to throw the low kick downwards, this is the correct movement of the leg when throwing a low kick.

## Mistakes & Learnings
- **Don't put my foot on point**, this will only reduce my power and give my opponent the opportunity to sweep me.
- **Use my hips to add power**, when I throw a kick I keep static and don't rotate with my leg to add power.
