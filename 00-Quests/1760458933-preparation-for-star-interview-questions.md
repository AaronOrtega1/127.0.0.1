# Quest: Preparation for STAR Interview Questions
## STAR Refresher:
- **S - Situation:** Set the context. What was the project, task, or challenge? Be specific but concise.
- **T - Task:** What was your specific responsibility or goal in that situation?
- **A - Action:** What specific steps did you take? This is the **most critical** part. Use "I" statements (e.g., "I analyzed", "I coordinated", "I proposed").
- **R - Result:** What was the outcome? Quantify it if possible (e.g., "which led to 15% reduction in costs", "and as a result, the client renewed their contract"). Always end on a positive note.
