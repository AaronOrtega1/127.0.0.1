# Systematic Strategy for Solving Coding Problems
## Summary
We need to **fully understand** what the problem is before starting to code, what the input and outputs will be. **Look for edge cases** and come up with a **simple solution** that work, even if it's not the most optimal one. Then we can start focusing on the **complexity and identifying inefficiencies**, and continue improving our solution.

## Content
1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

*"Applying the right technique"* is where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms comes in handy.
