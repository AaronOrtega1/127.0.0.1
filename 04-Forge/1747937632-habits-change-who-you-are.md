# Habits Change Who You Are
## Content
>[!NOTE] Principal Idea
> Habits don't consist on obtaining something. Habits consist in becoming someone.

- Developing a habit is not something we have to obtain something, since that is not the final purpose. The real final purpose is for that habit to change the person that we are, that is what really will help us in becoming a better version of ourselves.
