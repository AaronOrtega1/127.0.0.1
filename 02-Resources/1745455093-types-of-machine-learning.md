# Types Of Machine Learning
## Summary

## Key Ideas
- [[1745455124-supervised-learning|Supervised Learning]]
	- Training an algorithm resembles a teacher supervising her students.
	- Labelled data.
		- We know the target prior to the shot.
		- We can associate that shot with a target.
		- This allows to measure the inaccuracy through the objective function.
		- Improve the way the robot shoots with the optimization algorithm.
- [[1745455183-unsupervised-learning|Unsupervised Learning]]
	- When there isn't time or resources to associate certain data to targets we use this type.
	- Unlabeled data.
		- Neither the robot or you will have separated the arrows and tell him to fire in any direction without telling him the target.
		- In this case we will no be looking for a model that helps the robot shoot better, we will be looking for a model that divides the arrows in a certain way.
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]
	- We add a reward system to the model.
		- If the robot shoots a arrow better it will receive a reward, if not it will receive nothing.
	- It maximize the objective function.
