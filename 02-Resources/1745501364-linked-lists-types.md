# Linked Lists Types
## Summary

## Key Ideas
- There are three basic forms of linked lists:
	- **Singly linked list:** Each node has only one pointer to the next node. ^SinglyLinkedList

	- **Doubly linked list:** Each node has the addresses to both the previous and the next node. They are good If you want to be able to move both up and down in the list. ^DoublyLinkedList
		- ![[1745501364-linked-lists-types-1.webp]]
	- **Circular linked list:** Similar to a singly or doubly linked list with the first node, the *"head"*, and the last node, the *"tail"*, connected. ^CircularLinkedList
