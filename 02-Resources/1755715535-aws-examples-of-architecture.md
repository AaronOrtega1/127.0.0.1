# AWS Examples of Architecture
- For a **Solutions Architect**, seeing real-world architecture patterns is crucial.
- AWS provides **reference architectures, diagrams, and implementation guides** to help design and deploy applications.
- These resources cover both **classic architectures** (e.g., **EC2**, **ELB**, **RDS**, **ElastiCache**) and **serverless/cloud-native architectures** (e.g., **S3**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **CloudFront**, **API Gateway**).

## Key Resources
### 1. AWS Architecture Center
- A central repository of **reference architecture examples and diagrams**.
- Contains **over 2,000 architecture diagrams** across various domains.
- Features:
  - Filter by **use case**, **service**, or **industry**.
  - Downloadable in **PDF** or **HTML** format.
  - Includes **CloudFormation templates** for implementation.
- Examples:
  - **Disaster Recovery solutions** for relational databases.
  - **WordPress best practices** on AWS.
**Usage Tips:**
- Use filters to narrow down diagrams relevant to your use case.
- Diagrams include detailed explanations and step-by-step guidance.
- Templates help in quickly deploying reference architectures in your account.

### 2. AWS Solutions Library
- Provides **vetted solutions and guidance** for technical and business use cases.
- Each solution includes:
  - **Architecture diagrams**.
  - **CloudFormation templates** for direct deployment.
  - **Implementation guides** and source code (often on GitHub).
- Example: **Live Streaming on AWS**
  - Architecture ensures **high availability** and **reliable real-time streaming**.
  - Supports multiple architectures using **S3**, **Lambda**, **CloudFront**, etc.
  - Templates allow direct deployment via the AWS console.
- Browsing options:
  - By **industry**, **cross-industry**, **technology**, or **organization type**.
  - Filter by serverless, storage, compute, or other technologies.
  - Example search: **Serverless Image Handler** shows **smart cropping**, moderation, and other serverless image processing patterns.

## Benefits for Solutions Architects
- Provides **hands-on, real-world architectural examples**.
- Bridges the gap between **conceptual knowledge** and **practical deployment**.
- Enables fast experimentation and learning using **CloudFormation templates**.
- Helps in **exam preparation** by understanding AWS best practices and recommended architectures.
