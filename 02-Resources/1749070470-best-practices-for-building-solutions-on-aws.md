# Best Practices For Building Solutions On AWS
## Summary
- As you design solutions, evaluate **trade-offs** and base your decisions on empirical data.
### Best Practices when building solutions on AWS:
- Implement scalability.
- Automate your environment.
- Treat resources as disposable.
- Use loosely-coupled components.
- Design services, not servers.
- Choose the right DB solution.
- Avoid single points of failure.
- Optimize for cost.
- Use caching.
- Secure your entire infrastructure.
## Key Ideas
### Trade-Offs
- Think carefully about trade-offs so you can select an optimal approach.
- Base design decisions on empirical data.

- Ensure that your architecture can handle changes in demand.

### Automating Your Environment
- Automate the provisioning, termination, and configuration of resources.

### Use [[1743728182-infrastructure-as-a-code|IaC]]
- Provision your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes.

### Treating Resources As Disposable
- Take advantage of the dynamically provisioned nature of cloud computing.
### Using Loosely Coupled Components
- Design architectures with independent components.

### Designing services, not servers
- Use the breadth of AWS services. Don't limit your infrastructure to servers.
- Often managed solutions can be better and cheaper than server-based solutions.
### Choosing the right DB solution
- Match technology to the workload, not the other way around.
### Avoiding single points of failure
- Assume everything fails. Then, design backward.

### Optimizing for cost
- Take advantage of the flexibility of AWS to increase your cost efficiency.
### Using caching
- Minimize redundant data retrieval operations, improving performance and cost.

### Securing your entire infrastructure
- Build security into every layer of your infrastructure.
