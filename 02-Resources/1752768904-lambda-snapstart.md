# Lambda SnapStart
## Summary
- 

## Key Ideas
### What is Lambda SnapStart?
- Improves your Lambda functions performance up to 10x at no extra cost for Java, Python & .NET.
- When enabled, function is invoked form a pre-initialized state (no function initialization from scratch).
- When you publish a new version:
  - Lambda initializes your function.
  - Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function.
  - Snapshot is cached for low-latency access.
