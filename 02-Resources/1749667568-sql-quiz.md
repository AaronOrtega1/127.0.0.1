# SQL Quiz
### Basic SQL Concepts
- What is SQL?;;SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- What are the main categories of SQL commands?;;DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DCL (Data Control Language), and TCL (Transaction Control Language).
- What does a `SELECT` statement do?;;It retrieves data from one or more tables in a database.
- How do you select all columns from a table?;;`SELECT * FROM table_name;`
- What is a primary key?;;A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
### Intermediate SQL Concepts
- What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?;;`WHERE` filters rows before grouping, while `HAVING` filters after grouping.
- What is a JOIN in SQL?;;A JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- What are the different types of JOINs?;;INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.
- What is an index in SQL?;;An index improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval (like a book index).
- What is a subquery?;;A query nested inside another SQL statement (e.g., inside SELECT, WHERE, or FROM).
### Advanced SQL Concepts
- What is a stored procedure?;;A precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database for reuse.
- What is a trigger?;;A database object that automatically executes in response to certain events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE).
- What is a CTE (Common Table Expression)?;;A temporary result set defined within a query (using `WITH` clause) for better readability.
- What is normalization in databases?;;The process of organizing data to minimize redundancy by dividing tables and defining relationships.
- What is a transaction in SQL?;;A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit (ensures ACID properties).
### Advanced-Expert SQL Concepts
- What are window functions?;;Functions that perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`).
- What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`???
  - `DELETE`: Removes rows (can be rolled back).  
  - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows (faster, can't be rolled back).  
  - `DROP`: Deletes the entire table.
- What is a self-join?;;A join where a table is joined with itself (useful for hierarchical data).
- What is a deadlock in SQL?;;A situation where two transactions block each other indefinitely.
- What is query optimization?;;The process of improving SQL query performance (indexing, execution plans, avoiding full scans).
