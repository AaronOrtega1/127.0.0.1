# Sliding Window
- Maintains a window of elements within the data dynamically adjusting as you progress through the structure.
- Use when you want to find a sub-string or sub-array.
- Adds more versatility over the [[1751401172-two-pointers|Two Pointers]] pattern by giving you control over a range of elements at any given point.
- Usually combine with hashmaps to keep track up the elements within the window.
