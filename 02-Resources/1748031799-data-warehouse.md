## Key Ideas
### What is a Data Warehouse?
- Centralized repository that stores structured data (database tables, Excel sheets) and semi-structured data (XML files, webpages) for the purpose of reporting and analysis.
- Since it can store large amounts of information, it provides users with easy access to a wealth of historical data, which can be used for data mining, data visualization, and other forms of [[Business Intelligence]].
