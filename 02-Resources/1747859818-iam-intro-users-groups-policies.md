# IAM Intro Users Groups Policies
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### What does IAM stands for?
- Identity and Access Management, and its a **global** service.
### Users and Groups
- **Users** are people within your organization, and can be grouped, and can be in many groups or in none.
- **Groups** only contain users, not other groups.

### IAM: Permissions
- **Users or Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- The policies define the **permissions** of the users, by applying the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
