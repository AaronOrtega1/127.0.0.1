# Binary Search
- Used to find a target value in a sorted array.
- Technically an extension of the [[1751401172-two-pointers|Two Pointers]] pattern since it uses a left and right pointer that halves the list step by step.
- Allows to find the target in **O(log n)**.
- Can be used in any list where there is a monotonic function, where there is a consistent increase or decrease, this extends beyond numbers.
