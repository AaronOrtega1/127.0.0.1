# Divide and Conquer Algorithm
## What is Divide and Conquer?
- Problem-solving strategy that involves:
  - **Divide:** Break the given problem into smaller non-overlapping problems.
  - **Conquer:** Solve Smaller Problems.
  - **Combine:** Use the Solution of Smaller Problems to fin the overall result.

## Advantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm
- **Solving difficult problems:**  Is a tool for solving difficult problems conceptually.
- **Algorithm efficiency:** Often helps in the discovery of efficient algorithms.
- **Parallelism:** Normally used in multi-processor machines having shared-memory systems where the communication of data between processors does not need to be planned in advance.
- **Memory access:** Naturally make an efficient use of memory caches.
