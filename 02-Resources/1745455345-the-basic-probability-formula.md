# The Basic Probability Formula
## Summary
- We express probabilities with numbers to compute them easier.
	- $P(A) = \frac{preferred (favourable)}{all (sample\ space)}$
		- $A$ -> event
		- $P(A)$ -> Probability
- The probability of two events is the product of each event individually.
	- $P(A\ and\ B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$
## Key Ideas
- What is probability?
	- The likelihood of and event occurring.
- Why do we express probabilities numerically?
	- To compute which event is relatively more likely.
- Expected Values:
	- Average outcome we expect if we run an experiment many times.

- Definition
$$A -> event$$
$$P(A) -> Probability$$
$$P(A) = \frac{preferred (favourable)}{all (sample\ space)}$$
-  The probability of two independent events occurring at the same time is equal to the product of the probability of all individual events.
$$P(A\ and\ B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$$
