# OSI Model
## Summary

## Key Ideas
### What is the OSI Model?
- Conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers.
### What are the seven layers of the OSI model?
- **Physical Layer:** ^Layer1
	- Refers to the physical communication medium and the technologies to transmit data across that medium.
- **Data Link Layer:** ^Layer2
	- Refers to the technologies used to connect two machines across a network where the physical layer already exists.
- **Network Layer:** ^Layer3
	- Is concerned with concepts such as routing, forwarding and addressing across a dispersed network or multiple connected networks of nodes or machines.
- **Transport Layer:** ^Layer4
	- Primary focus is to ensure that data packets arrive in the right order, without losses or errors, or can be seamlessly recovered if required.
- **Session Layer:** ^Layer5
	- Is responsible for network coordination between two separate applications in a session.
- **Presentation Layer:** ^Layer6
	- Is primarily concerned with the syntax of the data itself for applications to send and consume.
- **Application Layer:** ^Layer7
	- Is concerned with the specific types of application itself and its standardized communication methods.
