## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
- Definition: The average outcome we expect if we run an **experiment** many times.
- An experiment is when we do multiple trials and record the outcome of each trial.
- The probabilities that we get after doing an experiment are **experimental probabilities** are good for when we are uncertain about what the **theoretical (true) probabilities** are or how to compute them.
$$
P(A) = \frac{succesful\ trials}{all\ trials}
$$
