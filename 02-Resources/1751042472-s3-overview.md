# S3 Overview
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### What is Amazon S3?
- "Infinitely scaling" storage
- Backbone of many websites.
- Many AWS services use S3 as an integration as well.
### Use cases
- Backup and storage.
- Disaster Recovery.
- Archive.
- Hybrid cloud storage.
- Hosting application and media.
- Data lakes & big data analytics.
- Software delivery.
- Static website.
### Buckets
- Allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories).
- Buckets must have a **globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)**.
- Defined at the region legion.
#### Naming convention
- No uppercase, no underscore.
- 3-36 characters long.
- Must start with a number or lowercase letter.
- Must **NOT** start with the prefix **xn--** and must **NOT** end with the suffix **-s3alias**.
### Objects
- Objects (files) have a key.
- The **key** is the **FULL** path:
	- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of *prefix* + **object name**.
	- s3://my-bucket/*my_folder/* **my_file.txt**
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets.
- Object values are the content of the body:
	- Max. Object Size is 5TB.
	- If uploading mor than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload".
- Metadata (list of text key/value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key/value pair - up to 10) - useful for security/lifecycle.
- Version ID (if enabled).
