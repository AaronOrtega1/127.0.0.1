# S3 Versioning
## Summary
- 
## Key Ideas
### How does it work?
- Can version your file in Amazon S3.
- It is enabled at the **bucket level**.
- Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1, 2, 3.
- Best practice to version your buckets.
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version).
  - Easy roll back to previous version.

>[!info] Note:
>- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null".
>- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions.
