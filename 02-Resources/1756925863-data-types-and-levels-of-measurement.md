# Data Types and Levels of Measurement
- Data can be classified in two main ways: by **type** and by **measurement level** [1].
### Types of Data
- **Categorical Data**: Describes categories or groups [1].
	- Examples: Car brands (Mercedes, BMW, Audi), yes/no answers to survey questions [1, 2].
- **Numerical Data**: Represents numbers [2].
    - **Discrete Data**: Can be counted in a finite manner, usually integers [2].
        - Examples: Number of children (0, 1, 2, 10), grades on SAT exams (e.g., 1000, 1560, 2400 with 10-point separation) [2, 3].
        - *Self-contained detail (not from sources): This implies a countable set of distinct values.*
    - **Continuous Data**: Infinite and impossible to count; can take on any value within a given range [3].
        - Examples: Weight (e.g., 68.0389 kg, 150.01 lbs), height, area, distance, time [4, 5].
        - *Self-contained detail (not from sources): Continuous data often results from measurements that can be refined indefinitely.*
    - **Money**: Can be considered both. Physical money (bank notes, coins) is discrete (e.g., you can pay $1.24, but not $1.243 cents) [5].

### Levels of Measurement
- **Qualitative Data**:
    - **Nominal**: Categories that **cannot be ordered** [6, 7].
        - Examples: Car brands, seasons (winter, spring, summer, autumn) [6].
    - **Ordinal**: Groups or categories that follow a **strict order** [7].
        - Examples: Rating lunch (disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, delicious) [7].
- **Quantitative Data**:
    - **Interval**: Represented by numbers, but **does not have a true zero**. Cannot represent ratios [8].
        - Example: **Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit** [9]. 0째C or 0째F are arbitrary points; 10째C is not "twice as hot" as 5째C [9, 10].
        - *Self-contained detail (not from sources): The difference between values is meaningful, but ratio comparisons are not.*
    - **Ratio**: Represented by numbers, **has a true zero**. Can represent ratios of things [8].
        - Examples: Number of objects, distance, time [8, 9]. If you have 6 apples and I have 2, you have three times as many [8].
        - Example: **Temperature in Kelvin** [10]. 0 Kelvin is absolute zero, where atoms stop moving, making ratio comparisons valid (e.g., 200K is twice as hot as 100K) [10, 11].
        - *Self-contained detail (not from sources): A true zero point indicates the complete absence of the quantity being measured.*
    - Context is important: Numbers can be interval or ratio depending on the situation [11].
