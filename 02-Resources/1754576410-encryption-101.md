# Encryption 101
## Summary
- 

## Key Ideas
### Encryption in flight (TLS/SSL)
- Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving.
- TLS certificates help with encryption (HTTPS).
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen.

### Server-side encryption at rest
- Data is encrypted after being received by the server.
- Data is decrypted before being sent.
- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key).
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere, and the server must have access to it.

### Client-side encryption
- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server.
- Data will be decrypted by the a receiving client.
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data.
- Could leverage Envelope Encryption.
