# Two Pointers
- Typically can solve problems in a **O(n)** instead of the brute force solution that can be **O(n^2)**.
- There are two main ways of using them:
  - **Same direction:** Ideal for problems where you are processing or scanning the data in a single pass.
  - **Opposite direction:** Typically used in problems that involve finding pairs or comparing elements from opposite ends of the data structure.
