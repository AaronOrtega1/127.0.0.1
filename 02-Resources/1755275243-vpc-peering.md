# [[1753149747-vpc-cheat-sheet|VPC]] Peering
## Summary
- Privately connect two VPCs using AWS network.
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network.
- Must not have overlapping CIDRs.
- VPC Peering connection is **NOT transitive** (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another).
- **Must update route tables in each VPC's subnets to ensure [[1748020848-ec2-basics|EC2]] instances can communicate with each other.**

### Good to know
- You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in **different AWS accounts/regions.**
- You can reference a security group in peered VPC (works cross accounts - same region).
