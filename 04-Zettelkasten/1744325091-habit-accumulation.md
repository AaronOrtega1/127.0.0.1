# Habit Accumulation
## Summary


## Content
> [!NOTE] Principal Idea
> Doing a new habit after one you already do can help you develop the first one.

### Explanation
- When we want to implement a new habit into our lives an easy way of doing it is by starting it right after we finish doing something that it's already an habit for us.
	- If we want to make a habit out of reading and we already have the habit of brushing our teeth in the morning we can start reading right when we finish brushing our teeth.
- This acts as a signal to our brains that its moment of doing the habit we want to develop.
